# Dutch Auction Smart Contract

A Dutch auction is an auction format where the highest price for the goods being sold is initially announced, and then the price is gradually reduced until a buyer agrees to purchase the item at the current price.

This smart contract implements a Dutch auction and is fully covered with Chai tests.
